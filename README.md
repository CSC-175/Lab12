# Perfect Number Finder

## Background
A number <b>n</b> is considered perfect if the sum of its proper divisors equals <b>n</b>. For example, the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. 
<pre><b>Examples:
6: Divisors are 1, 2, 3, and 6. 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. 
28: Divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28. 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28. </b></pre>  

## Directions
Write a program that will find all of the perfect numbers up to 10000 and print them to the screen. 
You should use a nested loop structure to solve this problem.
The correct output will look like the test case output shown below.
